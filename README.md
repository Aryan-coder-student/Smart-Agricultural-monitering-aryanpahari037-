# AgriTech 2.0

## Agricultural Challenges in India

Improper management of irrigation and soil fertility has contributed significantly to agricultural losses in India. Key factors include inefficient water use, poor soil management practices, and inadequate infrastructure.

- **Unirrigated Land**: Around 67.79 million hectares out of 180 million hectares of agricultural land in India are still unirrigated. This makes nearly 40% of agriculture rain-dependent, leading to vulnerabilities due to climate variability ([source](https://india.mongabay.com/2022/11/in-india-climate-impact-on-agriculture-is-already-a-reality-now/)).

- **Inefficient Water Use**: Traditional irrigation methods often lead to water wastage. Over-irrigation and poor drainage systems can cause waterlogging and salinization of soil, reducing crop yields. The Economic Survey highlights the need for efficient irrigation practices and better water management ([source](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1894900)).

- **Degradation of Soil Quality**: Intensive farming practices, overuse of chemical fertilizers, and lack of organic matter have led to the degradation of soil quality. This impacts the soil's ability to retain water and nutrients, ultimately affecting crop productivity ([source](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1894900)).

- **Nutrient Imbalance**: The overuse of certain fertilizers can cause imbalances in soil nutrients, leading to reduced crop yields. For example, excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers without adequate replenishment of other nutrients like phosphorus and potassium can degrade soil health ([source](https://prsindia.org/policy/analytical-reports/state-agriculture-india)).
